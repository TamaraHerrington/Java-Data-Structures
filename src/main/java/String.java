//exercise 1 pseudocode - use map function?

//convert string to upper case??? or character???
//convert letters in string to characters that can be counted


    // data structure FIFO??

//Input: string "Holy Mackerel Batman";
class countLettersInString{
    static void characterCount(String stringName){

        // according to w3schools: Creating a HashMap containing char
        // as a key and occurrences as  a value
        HashMap<Character, Integer> charCountMap
                = new HashMap<Character, Integer>();

//turn each letter in the string into a CHAR
        char[] strArray = stringName.toCharArray();
    }
}

//loop through each char and use get() and put()
// stringName++
